Fish Image Classification using CNN and Transfer Learning

This project focuses on classifying fish images into multiple categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained from scratch, as well as fine-tuned pretrained models such as MobileNet,VGG16, ResNet50,InceptionV3, DenseNet121
It includes model training, evaluation, visualization, and deployment using Streamlit for interactive predictions.
Fine tune pretrained model such as MobileNet perform well as compared to scratch model.
